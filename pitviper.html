        <p class="para">The Sri Lankan pit viper (Trimeresurus trigonocephalus) is a venomous snake species endemic to the island nation, residing in the diverse ecosystems ranging from lowland forests to montane regions. Also known as the Sri Lankan green pit viper or hump-nosed viper, this striking serpent exhibits distinctive coloration, with shades of green or brown that blend seamlessly with the foliage of its habitat. The species is characterized by its triangular head, vertically elliptical pupils, and a distinct hump on the nose, features that contribute to its unique appearance.</p>

        <br>

        <p class="para">Typically arboreal in nature, the Sri Lankan pit viper is often found coiled on branches or hidden amidst vegetation, using its cryptic coloration to ambush prey, which primarily consists of small mammals, birds, and lizards. This snake possesses a heat-sensing pit located between the eye and nostril on each side of its head, aiding in detecting warm-blooded prey and navigating its environment effectively.</p>

        <br>

        <p class="para">The venom of the Sri Lankan pit viper is hemotoxic, causing tissue damage and disrupting blood clotting mechanisms. While the bite can be potentially harmful to humans, fatalities are rare, and timely medical intervention is crucial for a full recovery. Despite their venomous nature, these snakes play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by controlling rodent populations and contributing to the overall health of their ecosystems.</p>

        <br>

        <p class="para">Conservation of the Sri Lankan pit viper involves protecting its natural habitats and raising awareness about the importance of coexistence. The species faces threats due to habitat degradation, deforestation, and persecution by humans due to fear. As with many endemic species, understanding their behavior, ecology, and distribution is fundamental to formulating effective conservation strategies. Ongoing research contributes to the body of knowledge about the Sri Lankan pit viper, aiding in efforts to mitigate potential conflicts between human activities and the survival of this unique and ecologically significant snake.</p>
