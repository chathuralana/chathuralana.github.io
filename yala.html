            <h2>Best time to visit</h2>

                <div class="sidepara2">
                    <p>The best time to visit Yala National Park is during the dry season, which typically spans from February to June. This period offers optimal conditions for wildlife sightings as the vegetation is less dense, making it easier to spot animals. The months of March and April are considered particularly favorable, with the latter part of the dry season being ideal for observing the diverse fauna, including the renowned leopards, elephants, and a multitude of bird species. The water sources within the park become limited during the dry months, concentrating wildlife around these areas, enhancing the chances of encountering a variety of species. However, it's essential to note that Yala National Park can get quite crowded during peak tourist season, so visiting during the shoulder months of February or June may provide a more serene and intimate wildlife experience. Additionally, it's advisable to check weather conditions and park accessibility, as occasional rainfall can occur even during the dry season.</p>
